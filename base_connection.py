class Connection(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    This is an abstract class that all connection classes inherit from. The purpose of this class is to act as a template with which to communicate with other computers in a rigid manner so that other programs can be built on top of it, without knowing what computers it might connect to iin the future.
    
    REMEMBER that all connections to remote computers should go through the 'checkSuccess' function so that connection errors can be dealt with robustly.

    The general idea is that when communicating between computers it is often useful to be able to control them, send files to them and check how much storage space you need. If connecting to computing clusters you may also wish to be able to check the job queue.

    MOST IMPORTANTLY whenever you make any kind of connection to the remote computer you want to make sure that the remote computer got the messge and if it didn't then you need to be able to keep retrying without overloading the remote computer with connection requests (i.e. DDoS attack).

        In order to initiate this class the user must have their ssh config file set up to have their cluster connection as an alias. It is best to set this up on a secure ccomputer that you trusst and have an encryption key without a password. Details about setting up the SSH config file can be found at my website.
        
        To better explain things I will describe a toy example that all doc strings in this class will refer to. The user has set up an easy connecttion to the remote computer by setting up their ~/.ssh/config file (either directly or through a tunnel) like:

        Uses rsync with specified flags (unspecified uses "-aP") to send a file to the remote computer. Source and destination only need the actual paths as the SSH connection will be done automatically.

        IMPORTANT: If you are unfamiliar with rsync then please read the manual or an introductory guide before using this function. Please remeber that a directory ending with no forward-slash indicates to copy the the directory and a directory ending with a forward-slash indicates to copy just the contents of the directory.
