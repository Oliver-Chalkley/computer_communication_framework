# remote-computer-framework
This provides a basic framework to build Python programs that use remote computers. It is simple, quick to pick up and does not require sudo. It is for Linux and is more for people who are new to the area and don't want to invest lots of time in learning new languages/libraies until they know the area better but also feel that writing everything from scratch is also a waste of time. This is simple and quick to pick up (I hope).
