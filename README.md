# remote-computer-manager
This provides a basic framework to build Python programs that use remote (Linux) computers. It is simple, quick to pick up and does not require sudo. It is for Linux computers and is more for people who are new to the automation of remote computers and don't want to invest lots of time in learning new languages/libraies until they know the area better (for example jumping straight into Hadoop might be a big step and not neccessarily the correct one) but also feel that writing everything from scratch is also a waste of time. This is simple and quick to pick up (I hope).
